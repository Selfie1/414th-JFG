    body: "The 414th Joint Fighter Group was formally established on April 7th, 2018. We are a casual mil-sim flight group based around DCS World, that provides training for newer or inexperienced pilots and a place to call home for those looking to be part of a multiplayer squadron. The 414th JFG is primarily oriented towards PvE combat, with an occasional mix of joint operations and squadron versus squadron (PvP) battles with other wings or squadrons in DCS World."
